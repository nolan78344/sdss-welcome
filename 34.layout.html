        <p>Normally, we think of a webpage as being a giant document, however, a more
            modern approach is to think of a page as a bunch of small documents placed
            on the screen together.  Each of those individual documents is a container
            element with html and other containers inside of it.  In fact, the concept of
            nested HTML tags is really a document within a document within a document.
